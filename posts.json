I am currently attempting to use it to detect which camera I am in front of by using a face detection if I am in front of my computer and either face detection or upper body detection if I am in front of another camera.   I have OBS use that information to decide what to show in my recording\/zoom call.  This is a rather odd use case, but appears to be the most reliable method I have found to automatically change scene based on my position (without me having to remember to do something).  My mechanism for doing this is by having it put a bright green square on my face using face detection.  I then have it apply a green square to my head, my shoulders, and my elbows using upper body detection (in case my back is turned).\n\nThe upper body detection occasionally triggers incorrectly, which causes problems for me.  These false positives can make my recordings change scene.  There is no situation I can think of where it sees my face and I don't want it to prioritize that information.\n\n**I would like to make it so that if the lens detects my face, it doesn't attempt the upper body detection and doesn't apply those filters.  Is there a way to do that?**","9":"I am currently trying to use SnapCam to detect which camera I am in front of so that my OBS stream can automatically detect where I am and switch what it shows based on my position.  I intend to use this for recording lectures, as I regularly switch between my computer (showing slides, examples, etc.) and a whiteboard, which I need to stream through a camera.\n\nI know essentially nothing about SnapChat lenses, but I am currently using Green Smileys and detecting if there is any green on the camera using an aggressive magenta chroma key and using Advanced Scene Switcher to select a scene based on whether there are changes in the screen.\n\nHowever, I don't necessarily face the camera for long enough for SnapCam to apply its filter, so I don't know how reliable this would be.  Also, I appear to be forced to use rather low resolution images (I can only have one instance of SnapCam open at a time and only one SnapCam driver, so I am putting the two images side by side), so its range is not satisfactory.\n\nIs there a filter that can detect if a person is present and cause bright green to appear on their body if they either facing the camera or facing away (or any other reasonable orientation), or apply the shade of green to movement?  If it doesn't exist, how hard would it be to make?\n\n&gt;!OFF TOPIC:  If there is a fundamentally better way get OBS to change scenes automatically in the way I want, please tell me.  I can't seem to find one, but this is off-topic for here.!&lt;","10":"## Post your requests here!\n\nIf you have a request post it here with\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* a short description\n* an image or a video of the desired object","11":"Hi everyone.

However, there's still some of the background that would show through.
